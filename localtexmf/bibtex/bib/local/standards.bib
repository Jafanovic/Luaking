%                    Synchronization Units Model (Szumo) to address the
%                    access-control problem in systems assembled dynamically from
%                    trusted and untrusted components. Our extension employs
%                    explicitly declared design contracts, the semantics of which
%                    are founded on Landwehr's model of fences and gates.
